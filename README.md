Problem Statement:
Communities worldwide face challenges in areas like healthcare, economic opportunity, and environmental sustainability. 
While Al has the potential to address these issues, 
Innovative solutions tailored to specific community needs are lacking. 
I-Hax 2024 Invites participants to develop Al-driven solutions that improve quality of life and promote equity, 
focusing on underserved communities and creating sustainable social Impact.

Project Description:
This web application aims to provide underserved communities with easy access to essential healthcare information and planning tools. 
It includes three key sections: a calendar for managing health appointments, detailed infographics for first-aid treatments, hygiene practices, 
and maternal & child care, along with an AI assistant for health-related queries.
